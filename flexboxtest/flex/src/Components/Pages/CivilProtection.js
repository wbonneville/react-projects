          <h1>City Data and Philosophy</h1>

          <h4>September 16th, 2019</h4>
          <p>
            We’ve checked out your predictions for this year’s City Data
            Portfolio survey, and of course we’ve mixed our own predictions with
            theirs. Some were bad. Things are looking up in the world of data,
            in fact. The annual survey has traditionally forecast where economic
            growth, population growth, job creation and the like are headed. And
            while this year we predict “roughly flat GDP growth,” and some of
            the population growth is “under-estimating the rate of increase,”
            we’re expecting population increases of more than 2 percent. This is
            likely to result in many new people, jobs and startups in City 17.
            We’ve added new questions about top concerns to make it more
            interactive this year, and just a sampling: Will home prices reach
            or exceed the all-time high of $113,625, adjusted for inflation?
            Will you expect the median price of a home to reach or exceed the
            all-time high of $135,000? Will jobs be described as “steady” or
            “dynamic”? Will the unemployment rate be described as “unusually
            low” or “unexpectedly high”? Will business owners be described as
            “lucky” or “job creators”? Remember to check back in August. We’ll
            have a comprehensive economic forecast for the entire area of City
            17, and if we’re correct, this will be the best forecast in five
            years!

            This is the 26th article in a series exploring how AI, robotics, and
            emerging technology will influence virtually every aspect of
            society. Each article is from a list that appeared recently in the
            magazine Mythic. At first glance, Philosophy appears to be a rather
            trivial discipline. Philosophy is not, in fact, entirely trivial.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Philosophy seems to be so easy to understand and so transcendent in
            its importance that we take it for granted. And, to be fair, given
            that humanity is plagued by many social and moral problems in each
            generation, we could perhaps blame an imagined collapse of
            intellectual complexity on a loss of consciousness or
            self-knowledge. Nevertheless, to consider Philosophy a mere subset
            of philosophy is to render it wholly moribund. The philosophical
            schism of the first half of the 20th century largely divided its
            practitioners into two camps. What became known as the “Protestant
            Movement” espoused a broadly philosophical and humane view of human
            nature, while the movements to be associated with Karl Marx, Joseph
            Stalin, and Mao Zedong, sometimes collectively called “the Communist
            Movement,” mostly espoused an anti-humanist and darkly inquisitive
            idea of humanity.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            In order to evaluate the wisdom of these predictions, it is helpful
            to recognize that ideological ideologies are adept at dissipating
            new information. To truly grasp how simple or complicated the
            presuppositions and opinions of each group were, it is necessary to
            consider a diverse array of methods used to measure their
            effectiveness, which can be summarized by a putatively unified
            ideology being defined by topsy-turvy ideas. The basic idea is, the
            higher up in a society one starts to go with one’s conceptual
            system, the less pure and individual they become. Ultimately,
            philosophy is a philosophical philosophy. This means that it is to
            the good of society to have as many people engaged in it as
            possible. Any good that the Soviet Union could have claimed to do
            led not only to economic and cultural progress, but also to the
            wholesale extermination of nearly 70 million citizens. In the
            absence of the ideology of communism or atheism, in the absence of
            the economics, business, and other specific domains that have been
            integrated into communism, the opposite of science happens.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Science comes to be characterized by anthropocentric moral
            grandiosity and pessimism, triumphalism and arrogance, and
            uniformity and monoculture. In the absence of philosophy, society
            will come to be characterized by mechanistic socialization and
            formalization, elitism and centralization, irreligion and atheism,
            religious fanatics and atheistic priests, robot revolutionaries and
            totalitarianism. It is entirely possible that, given the current
            political and economic rhetoric, it is largely unfathomable that
            under the banner of socialism, science has its most interesting
            phase.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            The challenge before us is to develop empirically demonstrable
            philosophies. AI, robotics, and emerging technology is like watching
            your fingernails start to grow. Few ideologies can last for very
            long under the strain that is placed upon them by rapidly evolving
            technology. Through trial and error, philosophy can, just might, be
            propelled into fresh life. Eventually, philosophy may again lose its
            place in the public eye. But, it should be noted, philosophy is no
            enemy of the majority. It is not everything, and it is not something
            else. Without such a philosophy, the majority may lose its sanity
            and become wretches and then wretches on. The challenge before us is
            to develop empirically demonstrable philosophies that can guide us
            through an increasingly difficult future, whether through
            philosophical clarity or similar artistic beautifications of
            humankind’s ability to reason and learn.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            If philosophy fails to stand the test of time, it is entirely
            plausible that this fact will ultimately lead to the exclusion of
            philosophical disciplines and, finally, the absolute extinction of
            philosophy. Philosophy is a terrible thing to contemplate. And while
            such thought creates a hardship, it may be required to protect the
            soul and free-thinkers from over-arching ideologies that have
            co-opted their minds.

          <h4>September 16th, 2019</h4>
          <p>
            AI can automate conversations, detect emotions, recognize objects,
            target advertising, and adapt its use to changing conditions and
            situations. In 2021, it could replace part of the workforce, freeing
            up humans for other activities. Most important, many will predict
            the gradual inevitability of having machines do our jobs. Large and
            experienced data scientists, who tend to have senior management
            backing, will probably be early beneficiaries of AI-driven change.
            Then there will be farmers, salespeople, lawyers, analysts, and
            journalists who can use automation for routine tasks while
            outsourcing work that requires creativity. Likewise, many retail
            employees — it would appear even the supermarket cashier — will need
            a new role. At the current stage of development, scientists are not
            aware of the resulting effects on the labor markets. The goal is to
            stay ahead of them, or, at least, to keep a good sense of the
            situation. This kind of uncertainty about the consequences of
            algorithmic change is a hallmark of life in new technologies. The
            researchers and entrepreneurs involved are forced to make
            assumptions about whether they can influence the future state of AI
            at their level, and they have a fiduciary duty to tell it like it
            is.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            That’s an unusual situation in human enterprises. It’s now obvious
            to anyone who has ever followed emerging trends in human cultures
            that uprisings such as the French Revolution, the American
            Revolution, the Russian Revolution, the Russian Revolution, and the
            Chinese Revolution were not the result of information and technology
            that simply revealed previously undisclosed truths to the populace.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Instead, massive upheaval resulted from people seeing that things
            had changed — and needed to change. This is what’s called “social
            unrest.” The Oxford Econometric Model (OEM) is a major and
            sophisticated (for now) scholarly research tool that most economists
            use to help make predictions about what will happen in the future.
            It arrives at the useful conclusion that within a decades,
            automation of routine jobs will make large numbers of workers move
            from the job market into unskilled service jobs — also, and
            unsurprisingly, far less desirable. It assumes that the workers in
            the service jobs have similar skills and that the economy will grow
            in these high-skilled “creative” occupations. It also indicates that
            with the ongoing expansion of robotics and AI, there is a distinct
            possibility that the labor market will become saturated with this
            new type of service occupation — essentially robot jobs.

          <h1>AI and the Combine</h1>
          <h4>September 1st, 2019</h4>
          <p>
            I think those who say the Internet will take over all economic and
            governmental functions miss a crucial point. While City 17 has
            succeeded in creating software that’s more intelligent than humans,
            it’s not necessarily adapting to the age in which humans live. Human
            intelligence, at least our working intelligence, must include
            natural speech and body language, and while some programming and
            coding might have improved over time, what’s called the “human
            element” remains.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            That’s a part of the challenge the next wave of artificial
            intelligence will face. Because humans have no engine of choice to
            inform them of what’s going on, they rely on biases and gut instinct
            to guide their decision-making. Unfortunately, this leaves humanity
            vulnerable to woefully inaccurate decisions, indiscriminate bias,
            and silly decisions. So far, AI can’t replace the sensibility and
            intuition of human decision-makers — but some research suggests it
            can make less reasoned decisions, based on implicit bias and
            stereotypes that reflect human nature.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            In March 2018, three researchers, led by Micah Sifry, published
            research about systems in China that seemed to consistently endorse
            results that were inconsistent with what the participants had said.
            The study was a naturalistic experiment, meant to illustrate the
            problems inherent in artificial intelligence. If we cannot make
            intelligent systems that develop without bias, we can’t make
            intelligent systems that act in the public interest. We are racing
            toward a horizon of real AI technology that could have a dramatic
            impact on the world. AI has the power to revolutionize everything
            from the economy to society. The impact of AI could be like the IT
            revolution.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Just as it revolutionized the economy by providing more efficient
            ways to run machines, so can it change government operations by
            providing more efficient ways to govern. The problem is, the time to
            get smart is before “humans are too dumb to use it.” It’s not about
            machines replacing humans. It’s about machines making better
            choices.
